      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>Many biological studies rely on high quality antibodies, but many commercial antibodies do not perform well (more than a quarter fail for histone antibodies; see "<%= link_to "Assessment of histone modification antibody quality", project_path(1) %>").  The problem is compounded by a lack of uniform standard and the laborious steps required for full validation.  The purpose of this site is to collect and to share experimental results on antibodies that would otherwise remain in individual laboratories, thus aiding researchers in selection and validation of antibodies.  This site began with the 200+ commercial antibodies tested as part of the <%= link_to "ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements)", "http://www.genome.gov/10005107" %> project sponsored by the <%= link_to "National Human Genome Research Institute", "http://www.genome.gov/"%> (USA), but the scientific community is invited to contributed their data.</p>

      <h2>Notes on use of the database</h2>
      <p>It is important to note that there is significant variability between different lots of the same polyclonal antibody.  The quality of experiments may also be variable depending on experimentalist.  Thus, the users should take the validation data here as a guide, to be further verified (and deposited!).</p>

      <h2>Funding</h2>
